# Baby Ideas

Babies need food and care and attention to grow into adults. They need us to change their dirty diapers and make mushy food that they can eat. They need us to spend time with them so they can learn to speak and learn to walk.

As they grow into children they need us to play with them and show them what to do and what not to do. As they grow, they learn to play sports and write and do math. Eventually, well raised babies grow up and become self sustaining, contributing members of society.

If we thought of our "bad" ideas as baby ideas, how would that change the way we treat them?
